# BIKE_SHARING-MY_FIRST_NEURAL_NETWORK
In this project, I have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other related concepts. I have also got to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems.
